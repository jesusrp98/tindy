TINDy is an app designed for the *Flutter Create* challenge. This project covers people's necessity of cat related photos.
It's like Tinder, but swapping human beings, with powerful feline creatures.

### Service
Uses the [TheCatAPI](https://thecatapi.com/) to provide us all with cute cats.

## Features
* You can **upvote** a photo by tapping twice, or pressing the 'Like' button.
* **Share** functionality is implemented. You can share your favorite feline photos with whoever you want to.
* If you don't feel writing upvoting a specific cat-related-photo (are you a monster?) you can go  to the **next** one by tapping on the photo, or clicking the 'Next' button.

As you can imagine, a 'dislike' function has not been implemented. You know, it's physically impossible to dislike a cat photo.

## Total size
Total size of the Dart code inside this project should be *5KB* or below. Run this command in the project's root folder:
```
find . -name "*.dart" | xargs cat | wc -c
```
Total size: 5043B.

## Download & install
First, clone the repository with the 'clone' command, or just download the zip.
